# **Deep Learning Repository** 🚀
A structured repository for deep learning projects, including datasets, models, experiments, and documentation.

---
## **1️⃣ Main Branch (`main`)**
### **README.md**
```md
# 🌟 Deep Learning Repository - Main Branch

This is the main production branch containing the most stable and tested versions of deep learning models and resources.

## 📌 Structure
- `models/` - Pretrained models and their weights.
- `datasets/` - Finalized datasets used in training.
- `notebooks/` - Jupyter notebooks for model training and evaluation.
- `tests/` - Unit tests for models and validation scripts.
- `docs/` - Documentation related to this project.

✅ **This branch should only contain stable, production-ready code.**
```

---
## **2️⃣ Development Branch (`dev`)**
### **README.md**
```md
# 🛠 Development Branch

This branch is used for active development, testing new features, and improving existing models before merging into `main`.

## ⚡ Workflow
1. Clone the repository: `git clone -b dev https://github.com/yourusername/deep-learning.git`
2. Create a feature branch: `git checkout -b feature-new-model`
3. Work on new changes and test them.
4. Merge into `main` after thorough testing.

🚧 **Warning: Code in this branch is under development and may not be stable.**
```

## **3️⃣ Dataset Branch (`datasets`)**
### **README.md**
```md
# 📊 Datasets Branch

This branch is dedicated to storing, managing, and versioning datasets used for deep learning experiments.

## 📂 Dataset Structure
- `raw_data/` - Original datasets before preprocessing.
- `processed_data/` - Cleaned and preprocessed datasets.
- `metadata/` - Descriptions, sources, and data summaries.

## 🔄 Versioning
To ensure reproducibility, dataset updates must follow proper version control guidelines.

📌 **Keep large dataset files in cloud storage and link them here when needed.**
```

---
## **4️⃣ Notebooks Branch (`notebooks`)**
### **README.md**
```md
# 📓 Jupyter Notebooks - Experiments & Research

This branch contains Jupyter notebooks for exploratory data analysis (EDA), training experiments, and visualization.

## 🏗 Folder Structure
- `exploratory/` - Initial data exploration and visualization.
- `training/` - Model training notebooks.
- `evaluation/` - Performance analysis and result visualization.

🔍 **Use markdown cells in notebooks to document key observations.**
```

---
## **5️⃣ Models Branch (`models`)**
### **README.md**
```md
# 🎯 Models Branch

This branch stores trained deep learning models and their weight files.

## 📌 File Types
- `.h5`, `.pt` - Trained model weights.
- `.json`, `.yaml` - Model architecture.
- `config/` - Hyperparameter settings.

📌 **Maintain proper version control for different model versions.**
```
